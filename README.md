# Nuilding

## Description
During the Computer Networks course, I developed Nuilding, a client-server application written in C for managing information about university building rooms. The application allows users to store and retrieve details such as owner, type, capacity, and interior images. It also includes search functionalities that enable filtering rooms based on specific criteria, such as identifying office spaces in a certain building with a limited number of occupants. The server component manages and administers building-related information. Through this project, I improved my understanding of networked applications, data management, and server-client communication.
